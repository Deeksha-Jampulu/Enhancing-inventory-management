# Enhancing Inventory & Execution

A data science project focused on optimizing inventory and warehouse execution using predictive models.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional inventory systems suffer from inefficiencies and poor responsiveness. This project uses ARIMA and machine learning to forecast demand, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce excess stock.

## 🎯 Goals
- Forecast product demand accurately
- Analyze seasonality and external shocks (e.g., COVID-19)
- Identify key drivers of customer satisfaction (packaging & delivery)
- Reveal patterns in inventory financials

## 🧠 Methods Used
- ARIMA for time series forecasting
- Random Forest for satisfaction prediction
- Correlation analysis and visualizations

## 📎 Contents
- `Enhancing_Inventory_Management.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code and results
- `Final_Presentation.pdf` – Summary of insights for stakeholders
- `Documentation.pdf` – Full project report (if applicable)
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## 📈 Results
- ARIMA captured seasonal patterns in clothing category
- Random Forest identified top satisfaction drivers
- Correlation matrix revealed cost-price relationships
- Insights help businesses reduce overstock and enhance fulfillment

## 🚫 Limitations
- No qualitative data (e.g., reviews)
- Did not include transportation or economic delays
- Some variables showed multicollinearity
